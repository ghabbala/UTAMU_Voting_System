##  Main Features

### 👨‍💻 Admin Module

- **Admin Login**
  - Default admin credentials (on first run):  
    - **Username:** `admin`  
    - **Password:** `admin123`
  - On first login with the default password, the system **forces a password change** for better security.
  - Admin can later change their password via:
    - **Forced change on first login**, and  
    - **“Forgot Password” → Reset password** if they forget it.

- **Forgot Password (Admin Password Reset and Student password Rest)**
  - From the login window, admin/student can click **“Forgot Password”**.
  - The system opens a **Reset Password** window and hides the login window.
  - Admin enters:
    - Username
    - Reset Key
    - New password
    - Confirm new password
  - Student Enters:
    - username
    - reg number
    - New password
    - confirm new password
  - If the username is valid, the password is updated in the database.
  - On success, the reset window closes and the **login window is shown again**.
  - A **“Cancel”** button allows the admin to go back to the login screen without changing anything.

  - Delete existing positions
  - Positions are used both in registration and the student voting interface.

- **Voting Duration**

  - System checks if voting is open before allowing students to vote.
  - Countdown timer displayed on student side.
